# FastText_Text_Classification


I have implemented "Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification" paper by #facebookai using #pytorch. One of the key concepts in the #FastText paper is that it calculates the n-grams of an input sentence and append them to the end of a sentence. I have used tri-grams. The beauty of the paper is the architecture does not have #RNN in it but still on par with many #deeplearning classifiers in terms of accuracy and way faster in training.
